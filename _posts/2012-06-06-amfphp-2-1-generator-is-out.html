<p>Silex Labs is proud to announce amfPHP 2.1. The project builds on the solid foundation of 2.0.1, and breaks new ground in making our users lives even more exciting!</p>
<h2><strong>Client Project Generation</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The main novelty here is Client Project Generation</strong>. We had a look at various code generation solutions, and thought that we could one-up them all: We don't just generate some code that you can copy paste from your browser into notepad. We generate a <strong>fully functional project</strong>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>service classes that expose your service methods so that you can call them easily.</li>
<li>a GUI class to access each service. These are great to make back offices.</li>
<li>project files to wrap them all and hit the ground running.</li>
</ul>
<p>And it's all done with an innovative template system that allows us to integrate new client technologies in record time.</p>
<p><strong>We currently have generators for Flash Creative Suite, and for HTML/JS. Many more are on the way.</strong></p>
<h2>So, what else?</h2>
<p><!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>The service browser has moved from its plugin to a <strong>separate "back office" section</strong>, and it sits alongside the client generator. This makes it much easier to customize and maintain.</li>
<li>plugin development just got easier: We now have <strong>priorities for our filters.</strong></li>
<li>You can <strong>force the server to always return AMF3</strong>. This was not the case before and caused some issues.</li>
<li>A new Typed Object/<strong>Object mapping example.</strong></li>
<li><strong>access to AMF packet</strong>, messages, headers etc. is now possible from your services.</li>
<li>a <strong>new badass logo.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>And 3 new plugins</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discovery</strong>. This is a plugin that adds a discovery service, which can be called to get information about your services. It is used by the service browser and client generator.</li>
<li><strong>Dummy</strong>. What happens if a user or a robot sends a simple HTTP request to amfPHP? The dummy plugin handles this, and shows a static html page that you can customize.</li>
<li><strong>Included Request</strong>. allows inclusion of an amfPHP entry point script. This is so that a script running on the same server can include the entry point script and execute a request. Its a bit experimental, but has proved useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once more, thanks for your support!</p>
