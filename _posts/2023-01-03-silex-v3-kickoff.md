Silex website builder next version aims at bridging the gap between no-code, static tech and free software, [subscribe to the newsletter and be part of it](https://short.silex.me/news_en "silex newsletter ")

This is an article about the future of [Silex](https://www.silex.me/ "Silex website builder") by [Alex Hoyau](https://lexoyo.me/ "Alex Hoyau"), the official maintainer of Silex since 2009

![Silex v3 in 2023](/assets/twamjiao.jpg "Silex v3 in 2023")

[Silex website builder](https://www.silex.me/ "Silex free and open source website builder since 2009") v1 was [released as open source in 2009](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silex_website_builder), awarded and downloaded a million times, then [Silex v2 in 2010 was an online (open source SaaS) tool](https://www.silexlabs.org/silex-v2-createur-de-site-web-attendiez/ "Silex v2 changes") as well as a desktop installable app. It is time in 2023 for the v3 to rise. Every major release means a major rewrite with new tech, a new paradigm.

Today I'm aiming at a free and open source alternative to Webflow and WordPress Elementor/Divi, and it will be **hackable, self hosted, producing websites that are faster to load, greener, better at SEO.**

## No-code meet static, Silex v3 road map

I have been the developer behind all versions, I wrote 99% of the code and I have hold the vision from the start - and 2009 was before Wix, before no-code.

Today I envision Silex as the bridge between 2 worlds: **no-code** and [**JAMStack (static)**](https://jamstack.org/ "JAMStack technology") / Composable architecture. It will offer as a free and open source software all the key features of Webflow with these components, each one being a step in Silex development, this is as close as I can get to a **road map**:

1. A drag and drop web design tool, showing all the CSS features in a class-based style manager - that is the no-code part and it will be based on the [GrapesJS](https://grapesjs.com/ "Grapes JS web builder framework") framework. This part is today's Silex v2 scope, and will still be useful by itself for smaller simpler websites
2. An integration with any [headless CMS](https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/ "Headless CMS") - such as WordPress or [Strapi](https://strapi.io/ "Strapi headless cms"), to visually design your website with real data. More generally import any api (no-code spreadsheets like nocodb or airtable, shopify, WordPress...). This includes collection pages, loops/repeaters, dynamic properties
3. Integration with [static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/ "Static site generators"): components which transparently generate snipets of templates [(ejs](https://ejs.co/ "EJS template"), [liquidjs](https://liquidjs.com/ "Liquidjs templates"), [twig](https://twig.symfony.com/ "twig templates"), ...) so that we can create Jekyll or [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/ "Eleventy SSG") layouts

That is the plan, in that order.

## The Ambassador program

I am creating a small group of ambassadors. Here are the ambassadors goals:

1. Become a Silex champion
2. Make sure Silex becomes a useful no-code tool
3. Grow the community and make Silex a sustainable open source project

Please apply for a seat at the new ambassador program: email me or ping me [in the forums](https://short.silex.me/community "Silex forums") or [in the chat](https://short.silex.me/chat "Silex chat")

## Motivations

I'm a fan of no-code in general and Webflow in particular, I admit it ! But their pricing is a bit off and I want to be able to make sites with **static / JAMStack technology / Composable architecture**

I also like being able to **host websites and the app** on my (green) server and have the code of my sites versioned with git.

I want to be able to **invite any number of users without worrying** about the cost, why would it be more expensive to have people accessing the website I am working on?

I will never again accept to have a tool of mine **decommissioned or updated to a new version**, making it impossible or painful for me to continue working on a client website. I want to be able to revert to a previous version, and to keep a per-website apps versions.

And finally I need to be sure that **anything is possible** with the tool I use for my clients. Whether I want to edit something in the UI, white label something or change the whole CMS for another product. This is me working on my tool, I don't want to be charged more for my own time.

Open source gives you all that.

My other motivations

* [Silex Labs](https://www.silexlabs.org/ "Silex Labs organization") or other NGOs need free tools
* [Internet 2000](https://internet2000.net/ "Green websites") need a self hostable hackable tool to create green websites
* No code has serious **alternatives for everything but Webflow** (unfortunately most of them are open core, which is the freemium of open source):
  * Bubble has [Appsmith](https://alternativeto.net/software/appsmith/about/)
  * Airtable has [NocoDB](https://alternativeto.net/software/nocodb/about/)
  * Notion has [AppFlowy](https://alternativeto.net/software/appflowy/about/)
  * Make/integromat has [n8n.io](https://alternativeto.net/software/n8n-io/about/) and [Node Red](https://nodered.org/ "nodered no-code")
  * Zapier and IFTTT have [Huginn](https://alternativeto.net/software/huginn/about/)
  * ...
