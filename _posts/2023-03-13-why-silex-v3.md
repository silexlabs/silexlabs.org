TLDR; [Internet 2000 web studio](https://internet2000.net/ "eco-conception sites web") is investing time to develop the next major version of [Silex free open source website builder](https://www.silex.me/ "Silex no-code website builder"). Here is why.

Hello makers!

I would like to tell you why we, as a small web design studio are investing time and efforts in the new version of a free and open source website builder. 

Here are three reasons why, here you go :)

## A new paradigm in the web design world: _design on real data_

The first reason why we do this is that Silex, the #1 free and open source website builder is not a website builder anymore until it has this feature which was made a standard by Webflow, this great website builder. They have this thing they call **design on real data**.

We want Silex to benefit this new way of designing, free and open source software.

How does it work? [Webflow includes a cms, fully integrated](https://webflow.com/cms) and you can design the content of the CMS durectly in the website builder. In the designer tool, you can drag and drop lists, texts and images, you open the pages created in the CMS, and you manipulate the real data. When you update the content in the CMS you see it in your website builder.

Even better: when you publish a new version of the design, the data stays dynamic. If you or your client make edits to the content, the website keeps updating.

## No-code + open source = free to learn, free to evolve, more profitable

The second reason why is that we wanted this no-code magic to be **free and open source**.

We used Webflow for a while and - beside the problems of pricing, we suffered limitations: we wanted the code of our websites to be exactly the way we wanted and it wasn't possible even if we had skills and and money and time to do it. We couldn't do it in Webflow, we can do it with the open source silex.

Also did you notice that **no-code and open source**  have a lot in common? They both **empower people** with **new opportunities**, it is made for you to **grow with the tool** and the **community** is really at the center of these.

## No-code + JAMStack = ultimate performance

The last reason why we went for a rewrite of the open source website builder silex is that we need to **own our tools**. As a buisness, as professionals, we want our websites to be static, we want to **design JAMStack web sites with no-code**. With silex v3 we can do this.

## What does it look like?

You **bring your own headless CMS** and **static site generator**.

At Internet 2000 we use Directus and 11ty.

You have access to the CMS data in Silex and design **a website which is static**. That's the challenge. The alpha version is released and the beta is coming. Come and visit [silex.me](https://www.silex.me "Silex website") where there is [an article explaining the plan in details](). And [here is the corresponding road map.](https://github.com/orgs/silexlabs/projects/1/views/7 "Silex roadmap ")
